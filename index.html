      <p>My name is Dina Kaytor. I am currently working full time as a Finance Manager. I have been doing this for over 20 years. My work has put me on several projects with IT. These projects have made me realize how exciting and interesting technology is. I consider myself a perpetual student and will always work on learning new things. I love puzzles and technology is like one big puzzle!</p>

      <p>I have a BS in Accounting and an MBA in Finance. Since Finance and IT work together so often, my finance skills will give me an advantage when IT works with Finance.</p>

      <p>I have led a robotics project, automating routine accounting functions. My love of technology has resulted in my becoming a super user on several financial systems. I look to continue to leverage my finance skills with technology to become a better IT partner.</p>
